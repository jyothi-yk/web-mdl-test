The history of telecommunication and data transport is a long one. 
There is a strategic advantage in being able to send a message as quickly as possible (or at least, more quickly than your competition).
 The Internet is not alone in providing instantaneous digital communication.
 Earlier technologies like radio, telegraph, and the telephone provided the same speed of communication, albeit in an analog form.

The previous section briefly described the different types of server that one might find in a real-world website. In such a site, not only are there different types of server, but there is often replication of each of the different server types. A busy site can receive thousands or even tens of thousands of requests a second; globally popular sites such as Facebook receive millions of requests a second.
IT involves many things. Take, for instance, an IT department in a company. There are many people with many jobs and varied responsibilities. These responsibilities range from keeping systems and data secure to keeping networks up and running. There are people who input data, people who manage databases and people who do programming. There are also the decision makers, such as Chief Information Officers (CIOs), who decide how an IT department will operate and what components will be purchased.

IT also includes the management of data, whether it is in the form of text, voice, image, audio or some other form. It can also involve things related to the Internet. Computer servers run business applications. Servers interact with client users and other servers across one or more business networks. Storage is any kind of technology that holds information as data. Information can take any form including file data, multimedia, telephony data and Web data, data from sensors or future formats. Storage includes volatile random access memory (RAM) as well as non-volatile tape, hard disk and solid-state flash drives.

IT architectures have evolved to include virtualization and cloud computing, where physical resources are abstracted and pooled in different configurations to meet application requirements. Clouds may be distributed across locations and shared with other IT users.

A single web server that is also acting as an application or database server will be hard-pressed to handle more than a few hundred requests a second, so the usual strategy for busier sites is to use a server farm. The goal behind server farms is to distribute incoming requests between clusters of machines so that any given web or data server is not excessively overloaded, as shown in Figure 1.15. Special devices called load balancers distribute incoming requests to available machines. Even if a site can handle its load via a single server, it is not uncommon to still use a server farm because it provides failover redundancy; that is, if the hardware fails in a single server, one of the replicated servers in the farm will maintain the siteâ€™s availability. In a server farm, the computers do not look like the ones in your house.
